#+TITLE: Sprint 3 Planning - Review and Retrospective
* Notes from Demo
** Testing:
    - More frontend test for pagination (need to show actual clicking and results page of paginated items)
    - Backend test NEEDS to have pagination test as well
    - The radius backend test needs to be more robust- can't simply just compare the length of the JSON response given back
    - Tests for prior search terms need to be present
    - More complete tests for the UI -- idk what that means?
** Random:
    - Put the error message in the results page if someone searches a garbage query
    - Security:
    - A person canâ€™t access any feature of the application without logging in - redirect them to a login
    - Passwords needs to be hashed - show next time in Firebase
    - Only accessible through SSL (https)
** UI Elements:
    - Page numbers for results need to be bigger
    - Actual pagination is good; For next time, 5 max pages appear one time. "Prev" and "next" button to cycle through pages. Sliding window policy for more than 5 pages. --> need to figure that out in the frontend
* Review
  - We need to make *way* more robust tests for our features
  - We still need to implement the grocery list feature
  - There were some features that we were unaware of:
    - Sliding window policy for pagination
    - Having the buttons for pagination be "previous" and "next"
    - SSL (https certificate)
* Planning
  - See picture
