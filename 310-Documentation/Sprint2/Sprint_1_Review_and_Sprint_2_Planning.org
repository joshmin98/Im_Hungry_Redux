#+TITLE: Sprint 1 Review and Sprint 2 Planning
<2019-04-03 Wed 3:30PM>
* Sprint 1 Review
  - Verbal Feedback:
    - We need to add error handling for when the radius is 0; we must write tests for this case, and present the user an error (either on the Home Page or Search Page).
    - We need to convert radius input units to miles
    - We need to change the background color of the website from "white smoke" to something else.
    - We need to write tests for search result pagination
    - We need to center the Logo and Search Box on the I'm Hungry Home Page.
  - Report Feedback:
    - We provided inaccessible links to documentation (link sharing was off)
    - Inconsistent dates for our commits
    - Not following TDD (committing code before tests)
    - Need to add in quantative measurements in the "Simple Design" section of the report
  - Retrospective:
    - Make sure documentation is on GitHub
    - More sustainable pace for development
    - Write tests before implementation in all cases
