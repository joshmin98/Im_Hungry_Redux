* Sprint 1 Review
  - Verbal feedback:
    - We need to add error handling for when the radius is 0; we must write tests for this case, and present the user an error (either on the Home Page or Search Page).
    - We need to change the background color of the website from "white smoke" to something else.
    - We need to write tests for search result pagination
    - We need to center the Logo and Search Box on the I'm Hungry Home Page.
