#+TITLE: Scrum 3 Meeting Notes

* Joshua Min
  - Since last meeting I added Travis CI to the project repo.
  - Unfamiliarity with using travis in a multi-language monorepo is keeping me from implementing CI checks on the backend
  - By next meeting I will add our backend and backend tests to Travis.
